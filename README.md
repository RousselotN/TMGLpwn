# TMGLpwn

\[THIS CODE IS STILL BEING IMPROVED AND IS PART OF A BIGGER STUDY SO WAIT BEFORE MAKING ANY CONCLUSIONS. THANKS\]

## What is it?
Code to proof test the TMGL format \*Sad music intensifies\*

The code is not really meant to be used anywhere else, but feel free to do so.
Why not Python? Because I wanted to have the results of the simulation before 2021.

## What does it do?
It prints the contribution of each maps to the final scores.
