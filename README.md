The code can be transformed in many different ways to obtain the desired datas. Lots of tests examples are detailed in the main to understand what kind of tests are doable.

## What is it?

Why not Python? Because I wanted to have the results of the simulation before 2021.

## What does it do?
It prints the contribution of each maps to the final scores.
